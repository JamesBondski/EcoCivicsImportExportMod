# Remarks
If you are looking for the actual mod, this is the wrong place. This is just a fork with some modifications that allow me to use it in a mod I am working on while keeping it current. Mainly, it prevents it from being loaded as a mod in Eco and changes the namespace to avoid any potential conflicts.
